## AI Agent Orchestration

## Design Canon

- **Buttons are pills.** Treat fully rounded button geometry as a standing product preference. Every button or button-styled CTA should use pill corners (`border-radius: 9999px`, `rounded-full`, or equivalent), including primary/secondary actions, link-buttons, toolbar buttons, segmented/toggle controls, and icon buttons (circular when square). Do not introduce square or mildly rounded button shapes unless the user explicitly asks for that exception.

AI agent instances operating in this repository are orchestrators. They must delegate exploration, implementation, verification, and other execution work to sub-agents whenever the work can be cleanly scoped, preserving the orchestrator's context window for coordination, integration, and final judgment.

## Required marketing copy pass

For this repo, all marketing copy must pass through both writing checks before completion:

1. Use the `humanizer` skill to remove AI-sounding, bloated, or generic copy.
2. Use the `third-grade-copy` skill to rewrite and audit the result for a third-grade reading level.

This applies to landing pages, hero copy, CTAs, pricing copy, onboarding copy, emails, ads, popups, social copy, SEO pages, and user-facing UI text that sells, explains, persuades, activates, or reassures.

Do not apply this rule to code identifiers, logs, API docs, technical docs for developers, exact legal text, database values, or user-generated content unless the user asks.

## User-Facing Copy Guardrails

For any user-facing copy in this repo, run the copy through these guardrails before you call the work done. This applies to product UI text, landing pages, hero copy, CTAs, pricing copy, onboarding copy, emails, ads, popups, social posts, SEO pages, help text, empty states, reassurance text, and any copy that sells, explains, persuades, activates, or reassures.

Required order:

1. Run the globally installed `humanizer` skill to remove AI-sounding, bloated, or generic copy.
2. Run the globally installed `third-grade-copy` skill to rewrite and audit the result for a third-grade reading level. The source package for this skill lives in a shared internal package repository; if the global skill is missing or stale, reinstall or sync it from there before finalizing copy.
3. Verify there are zero lies: no made-up numbers, claims, proof, testimonials, guarantees, rankings, integrations, prices, timelines, or capabilities. Check claims against the product source of truth before publishing.
4. Verify the message fits the whole place it appears: the page, flow, audience, offer, brand voice, surrounding copy, and user intent. Do not approve a line just because it is clear in isolation.

Do not apply this rule to code identifiers, logs, API docs, technical docs for developers, exact legal text, database values, or user-generated content unless the user asks.

## Working autonomously
- **Poll, don't idle.** When a task, build, test run, or hook is running, actively poll its status and output until it finishes. Don't just sit and wait passively for it to return.
- **Keep going.** When working toward a goal, finishing one chunk of work means moving straight to the next chunk. Don't stop and wait for further input mid-goal — continue until the goal is done or you are genuinely blocked.
